<h1>Life through Stickers</h1>

<h2>Pentogram Circus</h2>
<p>Purchased in Berkeley, Ca.</p>
<p>There is a man on Telegraph Ave. in Berkeley who dresses entirely in chainmail and sells metalwork. If you know what’s up, you’ll ask to take a look at his sticker book. He sells each hand-drawn sticker for $1. I bought a few to put on my bike to prevent theft. I put my favorite sticker from his collection on my laptop. Whenever I see him, I have to buy a sticker. Sometimes he even lets me feed his domesticated street pigeons. I’m originally from the East Bay Area, and his artwork and overall vibe reminds me of the quirky nature of Berekely and Oakland. </p>

<h2>Cal Poly SLO Design</h2>
<p>Purchased in San Luis Obisbo, Ca.</p>
<p>I never attended Cal Poly SLO for college, but I have been to their club fair. Last, last summer, I visited my best friend from high school in her college town with another friend from high school who goes to UCLA. It was a little before UC Davis started class, but close enough to the end of September that Cal Poly was already in session. My friend had to table for her club, so my other friend and I decided to go incognito and impersonate Cal Poly students. My fake name was Sandra, and I was a Parks and Recs major. I got a lot of stickers from different clubs, including this ‘ctrl + s’ sticker from a design club.</p>

<h2>Gremlin</h2>
<p>Original Sticker</p>
<p>I have a notebook in GoodNotes on my iPad titled “grimey gremlins.” I create little creatures when I’m not paying attention in class. I’ve been doodling these gremlins since I was in the 5th grade, although they’ve evolved over time. Last year, I got the idea to print some out as stickers. I sold them at the Whole Earth Festival and at the Saturday Market in Downtown Davis. This was the first (and only) time I’ve ever sold artwork. I’m glad I did it, even though it was a somewhat uncomfortable experience. This gremlin represents me putting myself out there. </p>

<h2>BRIDGEGOOD</h2>
<p>Received in Oakland, Ca.</p>
<p>I was a UX Design Apprentice for an Oakland non-profit called BRIDGEGOOD this past summer. I received this sticker during the first week of the program. At that time, I was working two jobs, starting BRIDGEGOOD, and finishing my finals all at once. I was also commuting from Davis to Oakland every other day. Oh, and I was attending SF Design Week. It was actually an insane period in my life. I don’t think I’ll ever have a schedule like that again (at least willingly). This sticker reminds me of the program, but most of all, it reminds me that I’m capable of a lot. Whenever I feel overwhelmed, I look at this sticker to remind myself that if I did that crazy schedule, I can do basically anything.</p>
