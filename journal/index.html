      <h2>Visual Thinking Strategies</h2>
      <p>Nov. 3rd, 2025</p>
      <p>The article “10 Intriguing Photographs to Teach Close Reading and Visual Thinking Skills” by Michael Gonchar highlighted the connection between visuals and close reading skills. Many images suggest a reference to an idea, rather than stating it outright (like in writing). Analyzing pictures and distilling their main message forces readers to slow down and consider deeper meanings. Visuals have a large impact on website design as well. But overusing visuals contributes to a clunky site with confusing meaning. Visuals should add to the experience, and not distract from the core message. I visited some of the websites from the website awwwards. Even though most of these websites are very visually striking, after a while, it becomes difficult to undertsand some of their core messages since the interaction design dominates the site. This concept reminds me of advice I’ve received about portfolio design. I’ve been told that while designers are tempted to add many interactions to their portfolio, you don’t want the design of the front page to upstage your actual projects. Additionally, adding heavy visuals to a site without optimizing the images contributes to longer screen loading times for users. On the contrary, heavy visuals add intrigue and transform a static site to something more dimensional. </p>

      <h2>Overlays Design Pattern</h2>
      <p>Nov. 3rd, 2025</p>
      <p>The article “Overuse of Overlays: How to Avoid Misusing Lightboxes” by Kathryn Whitenton outlines proper uses of overlays to ensure users are not frustrated when trying to digest vital information. Whitenton points to the 5 Ws — Who, What, When, Where, and Why — to guide designers when using overlays. Through this article, I learned that the use of overlays affects accessibility as well. For example, someone using a screen reader may find overlays disorienting. Typical users also occasionally find overlays disorienting — especially when the “exit” button is unclear. To help mitigate confusion, designers may label their buttons clearly with actionable items. Often, overlays contain important information (such as payment confirmation), so ensuring the user understands their purpose is essential. Overlays are great for calling attention to or building on important information on a page rather than introducing secondary items. Unfortunetly, many pop-up ads appear as overlays, so users are accustomed to quickly exiting overlays. For that reason, it’s best to include related information in overlays to highlight the preexisting content on a page rather than pivot from what’s already there. .</p>

<h2>Form Design</h2>
<p>Nov. 1st, 2025</p>
<p>The article “Best Practices for Form Design” by Salim Ansari illustrated the importance of proper form design. I found the consideration of psychology interesting in the context of form design. The article mentioned that clearly outlining the steps to users increases their likelihood of completing the form. Chunking the forms into small, actionable steps helps reduce cognitive load and visual clutter. Ansari repeatedly stressed the importance of proper UI throughout the article. Ensuring that the fields are sized correctly reduces confusion and increases the likelihood of form completion. Overall, this article made me reflect on the importance of forms in UI/UX design. They are often a users first impression of a site, and influence overall retention. They also hold valuable information (like SSNs, medical information, credit card info), so it’s importance that users have trust in the forms they’re using. </p>
